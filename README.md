Data Structures
===================
By [Steve Buckley](steve.buckley@gerrit-tech.com).


## Description
**Classic Data Structures** A set of various data structures I wrote, in Ruby.

> Linked Lists, with methods of insert_head, remove, size, search, and an override of the  method to_s in order to produce a CSV list of all node values.

> Stack, with methods of push, pop, and size.

> Queue, with methods of size, enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

> Binary Tree, as a demonstration concept, with methods to print pre-ordered, post-ordered, and in-ordered.

> Insertion Sort

> Merge Sort

> Radix Sort

> Binary Search Tree, with methods of insert, contains, size, depth, and degree-of-balance.  It does not rebalance the tree.

> Four methods to traverse a Binary Search Tree:  pre-ordered, post-ordered, in-order, and breadth-first.  Breadth-first employs the Queue data structure.
